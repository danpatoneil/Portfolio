# Daniel O'Neil's Project Portfolio

## Personal Project Portfolio
This website contains info on all of my projects for a portfolio. There's only one hiccup, none of them are real. Yet.
I didn't have anything that I wanted to put in a portfolio, so for now it's populated with some ideas that are still in process, but the descriptions are written as if they are complete for realism.

I used HTML and CSS because those are the basic tools of building a website. I had a world of trouble figuring out where my margins and borders should go and getting text boxes that are on top of images to change their formatting when the images are hovered.

## Installation
This is simply a github pages website, you shouldn't have to install anything.

Here is a screenshot and a link for the project hosted on github.io

## Use
Once this project is complete, or at least more complete than it is right now, it will be a valuable resource for prospective collaborators or employers to look at for information on how capable a web developer I am.
