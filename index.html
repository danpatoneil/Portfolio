        <h3>Ingredients Replacements Database</h3>
        <p>I love to cook in my free time, but the hand of fate has delt me an interesting wrinkle to my otherwise very approachable hobby that would be easy to share with my friends. A very very good friend of mine who I live near to has <em>several</em> food allergies including dairy, milk, and some kinds of wheat. Because of this, I have been forced to make myself an expert in ingredient replacements and substitutions. Complicating this is the expense, incompatibility, and inadequacy of many commercially available replacements like gluten free flours and commercial egg replacements. So I thought it might be worthwhile to make a database of what I know as useable replacements and make it available to the world. In this database one can search for an ingredient and find, if I have one, replacements for it with a breakdown of where this replacement would work and why.</p>

        <h3>Calorie Calculator</h3>
        <p>I've never found a good calorie counter app online before. I've found a ton of bad ones or ones that were somehow defficient, but they always seem to hold and present information in a way I consider more confusing than helpful. I decid I should put some effort into making a calorie counting app that would take information the way I think a person serious about keeping track of their calories would, with a gram scale, and give reliable results showing calories and macronutrients. All of my calorie counts are sourced from ingredients I've bought, so information is biased towards people like me, and my calorie counter is geared towards meal prepping large batches of food at once and portioning them equally.</p>

        <h3>Note Taking App</h3>
        <p>Wow just what everyone needed another note taking app we don't have enough of those yet right? To be perfectly honest this is by far the item I'm least proud of and it will be the first pushed off the list. I did this project entirely for practice developing web apps using cookies and I think it reflects well on my ability to do so but I'm not happy with it being a rather useless application otherwise.</p>

        <h3>7ordle</h3>
        <p>Simply put, this is a riff on the famous browser game now owned by the New York Times called Wordle. In this version, the word you are guessing is seven letters long instead of five. I decided to make this when I saw several other wordle forks popping up but all of them were focused on making concurrent worldes and I wanted to see how it affects gameplay when there are simply more letters.</p>

      <section id="lunch">
       <h3>Lunch Roulette</h3>        
       <p>This app takes your location (or zip code if you enter it) and finds fast food or lunch options nearby (as categorized by google maps) and makes a roulette of them to help indecisive groups or individuals decide where and what to eat. You can also remove or add items from the list manually.</p>
