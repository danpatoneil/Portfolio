        <h3>Full Stack Web Developer</h3>
        <p>I'm an aspiring Full Stack Web Developer. I decided to switch my career path into something where I could feel like I was building something, and decided to enroll in MSU's Coding Bootcamp.</p>

      <div class="card" id="oop">
        <h3>Object Oriented Programming</h3>
        <p>I have a background in Object Oriented Programming, and for some time went to school for Computer Science at DePaul University. While I ended up switching my major to Finance and switching schools, I'm still proficient enough in OOP to consider OOP roles, specifically with Java, C++, and Python experience</p>

      <div class="card" id="finance">
        <h3>Background in Finance</h3>
        <p>I have a Bachelor's Degree with a double Major in Finance and Information Systems Management from Wayne State University. While I am trying to move my career away from Finance and management, I do have valuable experience in those fields</p>

      <div class="card" id="need">
        <h3>I needed</h3>
        <p>To be perfectly honest with you I've mainly been focusing on the structure of the webpage and the CSS</p>

      <div class="card" id="boxes">
       <h3>Two more boxes</h3>        
       <p>And I don't have two more things to say here at the moment, but I felt like I should have 5 boxes. Once I have projects worth showing off I'll put them here</p>
